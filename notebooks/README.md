# Get started
The recommended mode of working with the notebooks is to use the [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension with the [Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension to connect to a container running on a CHAI server with access to `/nas`.

1. Click on the >< button in the bottom left of the screen.
2. Choose `Connect to Host...`
3. Connect to `vae.ist.berkeley.edu` or another host.
4. When the new window opens click `><` again and choose `Open Folder in Container...`
5. Open `./KataGoVisualizer/notebooks`
6. Make sure the recommended extensions are installed in the container (Python, Jupyter)
7. Change the kernel to `venv` (`/opt/venv/bin/python`)
